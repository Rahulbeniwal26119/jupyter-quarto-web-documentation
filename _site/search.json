The exponential growth model effectively captured the initial phase of the pandemic, and we observed a varying reproduction number across different regions. With a basic reproduction number ( R_0 ) of over 3.0 in some areas, stringent interventions were necessary to contain the spread.\nFuture work could involve a more detailed analysis of intervention measures such as lockdowns and vaccination campaigns, which would give a clearer picture of their effectiveness."
